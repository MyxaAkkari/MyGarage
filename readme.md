## My Garage!
### Requirments:
- Remove last car from JSON.
- Remove all cars.
- Show number of cars in list.
- Use map to add img to the page.

## improvments
- Instead of deleting the last car from array i made another array that contains fixed cars and moved the finished car to the other array when "fixed" button is pressed.
- The page displays two lists, cars added and finished cars, with a counter for both of them.
- Customized the GUI to make it look better (styles, bkg img, loading screen,etc..).
- Added an event listener for Enter keystroke while filling the input feilds to call for the addaCar().
- Made sure that the fileds are filled before calling the addaCar() func, if not error message is displayed.
